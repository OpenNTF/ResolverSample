	<!-- WebSphere Portal specific: indicates that the markup is written such 
		that it can cope with relative URLs. The main requirement is to place URL 
		only in places that are meant to contain URLs by the HTML spec, in particular 
		do not pass URL directly into JS functions Instead always write them into 
		markup and if a JS function requires access to the URL, first read it out 
		of the attribute of the DOM element and pass the result to the JS function 
		(the browser will resolve the URL to an absolute URL automatically, when 
		reading it from the attribute). -->

	<!-- WebSphere Portal specific: indicates that the portlet container does 
		not need to protect agains the duplicate execution of the same action. This 
		is important for cacheability concerns of the portlet, since with multiple 
		action protection enabled, the markup of the portlet is uncacheable if it 
		contains an action URL. -->

	<!-- WebSphere Portal specific: indicates that the server automatically 
		sends a redirect after an action. This is the desired pattern based on the 
		REST model, an action should always be represented as a POST request, followed 
		by a redirect the new state after the action. As a result all URLs in the 
		browser history and the address bar are bookmarkable and the back button 
		works without executing an action twice. -->

	<!-- Registers a resolver with the portlet and specifies that the resolution 
		process should map to a RenderEventListener. This typically makes sense for 
		portlet specific resolvers, since the RenderEventListener API is much simpler 
		and tailored towards initializing parameters for a single portlet. -->
